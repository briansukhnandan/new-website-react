Never realized how many train operators also appreciate railfanners! Even had one compliment my dyed hair which was neat. This also commemorates the start of this blog! Let's hope I can actually stay consistent with something this time...",

    "body": "I decided to head over the Hudson River and railfan some stuff in New Jersey! I caught some pretty cool engines: PATH trains, some NJ Transit, and a bonus Amtrak catch! The only downside was how infuriating it was to obtain a SmartLink card for entering the system. I ended up just using my MetroCard until I got into Newark and needed to purchase one. Side note, but after visiting DC and getting the Cherry Blossom SmarTrip card, the one for PATH looks gross. If you want to see what the SmarTrip card I am referencing looks like, please go visit my twitter @DBZ_Returns!",

    "body": "Recently railfanned The T while I was at PAX East 2024! Got a chance to get a shot of all lines except for silver since it's a bus line. Overall, I didn't feel very safe railfanning in certain stations late at night (Downtown Crossing & State to name a few), and there were also a lot of delays the weekend I went. The Orange line was even suspended between Jackson Sq. and North Station the first night I went! Ridiculous! One of the only redeeming factors of my trip was that the Green Line operators were super nice when they saw me filming.",

Currently I am just biting my time until I get to film the London Underground, as that is my next big milestone. In the meantime though, I'm going to try and finish off my NYC subway collection (essentially just railfanning the line). The only ones left are the 8 Ave line, the G, and S trains."
